## Dropdown Menu 

Animated multi-level dropdown menu inspired by Facebook's March 2020 web UI. 

Watch the full [React dropdown tutorial](https://youtu.be/IF6k0uZuypA) on YouTube by Jeff Delaney.

git clone <this-repo>

npm i
npm start
```


I realised after searching a lot, such multilevel advanced animated menu tutorials don't exist. Maybe there are some yeah,but after trying to find a really good on for a long time, I finally landed upon this video that did exactly whatI wanted. and what I wanted was to re-create youtube player's settings dropup. ( you can see it ini any video, there is a cog logo right below, where all settings such as captions customization and playback rate are ), and I just couldn't find it.this video/code was very close to this one, just it was limited to 2 levels ( primary and secondary ), so I extended it to 4 levels and found a general way to do so. I am a begineer js developer who loves modern web technologies, so I tried this. thanks to Jeff, I feel much better now.
