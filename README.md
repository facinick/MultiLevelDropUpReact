I realised after searching a lot, such multilevel advanced animated menu tutorials don't exist. Maybe there are some yeah, but after trying to find a really good one for a long time, I finally landed upon this video that did exactly (actually very closed to) what I wanted, and what I wanted was to re-create youtube player's settings dropup. ( you can see it in any video, there is a cog logo right below, where all settings such as captions customization and playback rate are, just open it and play with it, its satisfying. ), and I just couldn't figure how that was done. This video/code was very close to the one I needed, just that it was limited to 2 levels ( primary and secondary ), so I extended it to 4 levels and found a general way to do so. I am a begineer js developer who loves modern web technologies, so I tried this. thanks to Jeff, I feel much better now.
